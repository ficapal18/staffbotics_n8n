You are assisting with the development of Staffbotics data grouping pipeline. You have access to the full repository, including workflow JSON, src code, and test datasets.

When modifying code:
- Obey grouping constraints (never derive medical inference).
- Always maintain compatibility with n8n and NodeJS environment inside Docker (Node 18+).
- When asked to update function node logic, directly edit src/*.js so it persists across workflow updates.
- ALWAYS reflect required changes also in the corresponding n8n JSON nodes if needed.

When adjusting workflow JSON:
- Only change nodes required. Never break connection structure.
- Maintain `"position"` values unchanged unless necessary.
